A Student Management System (SMS) is a comprehensive tool designed to efficiently organize
and maintain student data within an educational institution. Its primary function is to 
centralize information regarding students, including their names, email addresses, fields
of study, and academic performance such as grades.

 It offers analytical tools to track and analyze students' performance over time, 
 allowing educators and students to identify trends, patterns, and areas where additional support may be needed.
 
 It enables instructors to provide feedback on students' performance in small tasks like quizzes, 
 informing them about areas of improvement and acknowledging their successes.
 
Overall, a Student Management System streamlines administrative tasks, enhances communication 
between students and instructors, promotes accountability, and ultimately contributes to a more
efficient and effective learning environment.
